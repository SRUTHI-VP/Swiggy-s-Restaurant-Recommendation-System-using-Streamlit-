🍴 Swiggy’s Restaurant Recommendation System using Streamlit
📌 Project Overview
This project is a restaurant recommendation system inspired by Swiggy, built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It leverages machine learning techniques to suggest restaurants based on user preferences such as cuisine, location, ratings, and cost. The interactive Streamlit interface makes it easy for users to explore personalized recommendations in real time.
🚀 Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and standardizing restaurant data (cuisine, city, ratings, etc.).
- Recommendation Engine:
- Content-based filtering using cuisine similarity.
- Option to extend with collaborative filtering or hybrid approaches.
- Streamlit UI:
- User-friendly interface for entering restaurant names or preferences.
- Displays top recommended restaurants dynamically.
- Filters:
- Cuisine type, budget, and location.
- Scalability: Can be extended with deep learning embeddings or API integration.
- 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for similarity and ML models)
- Streamlit (for interactive web app)
🎯 How It Works
- User enters a restaurant name or selects preferences.
- The system computes similarity using cuisine and other features.
- Top recommended restaurants are displayed in the Streamlit app.
